Manage cron jobs for the heartbeat daemon. Use `$ARGUMENTS` to determine the action.

**CRITICAL: Job files MUST be created in the project-relative path `.claude/claudeclaw/jobs/`, NOT in `~/.claude/claudeclaw/jobs/`.** The daemon only watches the project directory. Using the home directory path will silently fail — the job will never fire.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to identify the sub-command. If no arguments are given, list all jobs.

## Sub-commands

### `list` (default when no arguments)

1. List all `.md` files in `.claude/claudeclaw/jobs/`.
2. For each file, read it and display:
   - **Job name** (filename without `.md`)
   - **Schedule** (cron expression from frontmatter)
   - **Prompt** (body text, truncated to 100 chars if long)
3. If no jobs exist, tell the user and show how to create one.

### `create` or `add`

Create a new cron job interactively.

1. Use **AskUserQuestion** to ask:
   - "What should this job be called?" (header: "Job name", options: suggest 2 contextual names based on the project, e.g. "git-summary", "test-runner")
   - "When should it run?" (header: "Schedule", options: "Every hour (0 * * * *)", "Every 6 hours (0 */6 * * *)", "Daily at 9am (0 9 * * *)", "Daily at midnight (0 0 * * *)")

2. Then ask:
   - "What prompt should Claude execute?" (header: "Prompt", options: suggest 2-3 prompts relevant to the project context)

3. Create the job file at `.claude/claudeclaw/jobs/<name>.md` with this exact format:
   ```markdown
   ---
   schedule: "<cron expression>"
   ---
   <prompt>
   ```

4. Confirm creation. Remind the user the daemon hot-reloads jobs every 30 seconds — no restart needed.

### `edit <job-name>`

Edit an existing cron job.

1. Read `.claude/claudeclaw/jobs/<job-name>.md`. If it doesn't exist, list available jobs and ask the user which one to edit.
2. Show the current schedule and prompt.
3. Use **AskUserQuestion** to ask:
   - "What do you want to change?" (header: "Edit", options: "Schedule", "Prompt", "Both")
4. Based on the answer:
   - **Schedule**: Ask for a new cron expression with preset options (same as create).
   - **Prompt**: Ask for a new prompt with the current prompt shown for reference.
   - **Both**: Ask both questions.
5. Write the updated file and confirm.

### `delete` or `remove <job-name>`

Delete a cron job.

1. If no job name given in `$ARGUMENTS`, list all jobs and use **AskUserQuestion** to ask which one to delete.
2. Confirm deletion with **AskUserQuestion**: "Delete job '<name>'? This cannot be undone." (header: "Confirm", options: "Yes, delete it", "No, keep it")
3. If confirmed, delete `.claude/claudeclaw/jobs/<job-name>.md`.
4. Confirm deletion. The daemon will pick up the change on the next hot-reload cycle (within 30s).

### `run <job-name>`

Manually trigger a cron job immediately (useful for testing).

1. Read `.claude/claudeclaw/jobs/<job-name>.md`. If it doesn't exist, list available jobs.
2. Show the job's prompt and ask for confirmation: "Run job '<name>' now?" (header: "Run", options: "Yes", "No")
3. If confirmed, run the prompt. The CLI does not have a dedicated `run` subcommand — choose based on daemon state:
   - **If the daemon is running**, pipe the prompt through the default session so logs and session memory are preserved:
     ```bash
     bun run ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/src/index.ts send "<prompt>"
     ```
   - **If the daemon is not running**, execute the prompt standalone (no ClaudeClaw session context):
     ```bash
     claude -p "<prompt>" --output-format text
     ```
4. Show the output to the user.

## Reference: Job File Format

Jobs live in `.claude/claudeclaw/jobs/` as markdown files:

```markdown
---
schedule: "0 9 * * *"
recurring: true
---
Your prompt here. Claude will run this at the scheduled time.
```

**Cron syntax**: `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`

**Timezone-aware**: All cron times are evaluated in the configured `timezone` from `settings.json`. E.g. `0 9 * * *` with `timezone: "UTC+2"` fires at 9:00 AM local time.

**`recurring`**: If `true`, the job repeats on schedule. If omitted or `false`, the job is **one-shot** — the schedule is removed from the file after it runs.
Legacy compatibility: `daily` is still accepted in existing job files.

**`model`** (optional): Overrides the global model for this job (e.g. `model: haiku` to route a cheap recurring task off your default model). When set, takes precedence over agentic routing. When omitted, behaviour is unchanged.

| Expression       | Meaning                  |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| `* * * * *`      | Every minute             |
| `0 * * * *`      | Every hour               |
| `*/15 * * * *`   | Every 15 minutes         |
| `0 9 * * *`      | Daily at 9:00 AM         |
| `0 9 * * 1-5`    | Weekdays at 9:00 AM     |
| `0 0 * * *`      | Daily at midnight        |
| `0 */6 * * *`    | Every 6 hours            |
| `0 9,18 * * *`   | At 9 AM and 6 PM        |

The daemon checks cron expressions every 60 seconds (aligned to wall-clock minute boundaries) and hot-reloads job files every 30 seconds.

**Missed fires across daemon downtime:** Each job's last fire time is persisted to `.claude/claudeclaw/jobs-state.json`. When the daemon starts (or every tick), it walks each job forward from its recorded last fire and replays any matches that fell in the gap. If many fires were missed (e.g. after a long outage), they are coalesced — the job fires once and the count of skipped fires is logged. New jobs do not back-fill: their cursor is anchored to the moment the daemon first sees them.
